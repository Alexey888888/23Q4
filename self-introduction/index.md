###Transcript of my presentation:###

Hi! Nice to e-meet you! I’m Alexey. I’m from Minsk, but in 2023 I relocated to Bulgaria. So at the moment I’m living in Sofia. I graduated from Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, Faculty of Information Technology and Control.

Before relocation, I worked in the field of security and safety systems. In my job, I used to configure security systems, which also involved a kind of programming, but it was quite specific and not at all similar to programming languages. I had some experience supporting and creating content for a corporate website developed on WordPress. I enjoyed it, it was interesting.

Now I’m a student of the Rolling Scopes School and aiming to acquire a new profession as a front-end developer. I like the front-end because I can see the result of my work immediately, test it, and make adjustments right away. It's very engaging. Working with the front-end also provides an opportunity to express my creative side. I have good interpersonal skills and I like to work in a team. I constantly improve my skills and want to become a cool front-end developer and don't stop there.

During the course, I developed several really cool projects - Minesweeper, Hangman, and Nonograms. By "cool," I don't mean the quality of the code, but rather that these mini-games I developed myself. Towards the end of each project, I often find myself thinking that if I were to do it again, I would do everything differently. I would do everything better. Each new project offers unique opportunities for learning and improvement.

I’m fond of traveling and camping. Considering that I'm currently in Sofia surrounded by mountains, I discovered a new passion - hiking. Mountains are really amazing, not as amazing as programming of course, but still very cool.

Back in Belarus there were no foreign clients of mine. So now I'm getting out of my comfort zone constantly. This involves improving my English - I exercise daily and try to practice it. Learning JavaScript, developing new projects - is also an every day challenge. Still, most evenings I get over them. So getting over complications is becoming my drug.

I'm eagerly waiting what the future holds for me in IT!

Thank you for your attention.
